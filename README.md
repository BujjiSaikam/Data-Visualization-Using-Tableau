# Financial Analytics

### Description
Financial Analytics project aims to analyze financial data to understand the relationship between market capitalization and quarterly sales of companies. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, storage in an SQLite database, machine learning model development for prediction, and visualization of results.

### Project Goals

**Primary Objective**: 
- To build a predictive model that estimates market capitalization based on quarterly sales data.

**Secondary Objectives**:
- To perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships in financial data.
- To preprocess and clean financial data for accurate analysis.
- To engineer features that may improve the model's predictive performance.
- To store the processed data in an SQLite database for efficient querying.
- To visualize the results of the analysis and model predictions effectively.

### Key Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values, indicating the accuracy of the predictive model.
- **R-squared (RÂ²) Score**: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s), indicating the model's explanatory power.

### Technical Skills Used

**Programming Languages**:
- **Python**: For data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development.
- **SQL**: For data storage and querying using SQLite.

**Libraries**:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

**Software/Platforms**:
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **SQLite**: For storing and querying processed financial data.

These technical skills and tools were employed to preprocess data, perform EDA, build and evaluate the predictive model, and store and visualize the results effectively.
